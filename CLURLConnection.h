/*
 * CLURLConnection is a drop-in replacement for NSURLConnection
 *
 * A CLURLConnection is exactly the same as a NSURLConnection, except for the
 * behavior when receiving http status codes >= 400
 *
 * A NSURLConnection will send the connection:didReceiveData: message to its
 * delegate, even if the http status code is greater or equal to 400. The
 * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (RFC 2616) states that 4xx and 5xx status codes
 * are respectively client errors and server errors. A CLURLConnection will
 * instead send the connection:didFailWithError: message to its delegate with
 * an appropriate NSError of the hereafter defined HTTPErrorDomain.
 *
 * As a bonus, CLURLConnection also fixes a crasher when calling start without
 * calling scheduleInRunLoop:forMode: first.
 * See http://www.mail-archive.com/cocoa-dev@lists.apple.com/msg32455.html
 *
 * Tested on Mac OS X 10.5.8 and iPhone OS 3.1.2
